# Predict Bike Sharing Frequency with Artificial Neural Network
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) trained from scratch to translate predict bike share use.
![Overview of data, neural network, and output][image_overview]

## Project Information
The included [`./bike_sharing_nn.ipynb`](https://github.com/JackBurdick/predict_bike_sharing_use_frequency/blob/master/bike_sharing_nn.ipynb) provides a commented walk though of the network generation and evaluation.
